# UTPay – Expense Sharing System

A simplified version of **Splitwise**, developed as a command-line application in **C++**, allowing users to manage group expenses and calculate individual debts and credits.

## Overview

UTPay reads user and expense data from CSV files via command-line arguments and supports different types of cost distributions:

-   **Equally**: Costs are split evenly among participants.
    
-   **Unequally**: Each participant has a predefined share.
    
-   **Adjustment**: Some participants cover extra; the remainder is split equally.
    

The application simplifies transactions to reduce the number of payments required between participants.
