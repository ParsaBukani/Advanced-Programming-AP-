# Advanced Programming

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the course  
**“Advanced Programming”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Spring 1403**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Ramtin Khosravi**.

## Overview

The projects demonstrate essential concepts in C++ programming, including:

- Object-oriented design and abstraction  
- Modular programming with `.cpp` and `.h` files  
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling  
- Use of Standard Template Library (STL)  
- File I/O and data serialization  
- Real-world software architecture with layered design  
- Integration of a command-line and web-based user interface  

These projects reflect a practical and structured approach to learning advanced programming concepts.
