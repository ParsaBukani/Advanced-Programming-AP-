# Recursive Problem Set

This project contains solutions to three recursive problems implemented in **C++**, developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course at the **University of Tehran – Winter 1402**.  
The focus of these problems is on **recursive thinking** and **clean code structure**.

##  Problems Overview

### 1. 🧮 Constructing Numbers Using Only Digit '1'

Determine the minimum number of digit `1`s required to construct a given number using only **addition and subtraction**.  
For example:  
`10 = 11 - 1` → 3 ones  
`1212 = 1111 + 111 - 11 + 1` → 10 ones

### 2. 📁 Directory Tree Visualization

Simulate the `tree` command in Linux.  
Given a list of items and their parent-child relationships, recursively print the **hierarchical directory structure** up to a given depth using indentation and branch symbols.

### 3. 🚇 Metro Route Optimization

Given a map of metro lines and intersections, calculate the **shortest time** to travel from a starting point to a destination.  
The route must consider:
- 1 minute per station
- 2 minutes per line transfer  
A modified **BFS** or recursive traversal is used to minimize total travel time.
